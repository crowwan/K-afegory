ðŸ˜»A New Korean Sentiment Lexicon based on SNS and Opinion Mining based on Naver Blog

## Problem Statement 
-	Opinion mining by sentiment-analysis based on Naver Blog
-	Data related in cafe


 Existing sentiment analysis on review data proceeds by labeling using the star rating of the review and classifying using it. But social data is difficult to find labeled data. Therefore, in this project, sentiment analysis is carried out using the sentiment dictionary.
 
 Since the published KNU Korean Emotional Dictionary collects only basic human emotional expressions, there are no expressions suitable for cafe reviews such as â€˜willing to visit againâ€™ or â€˜feel the vibesâ€™. Therefore, after creating a new Korean Sentiment Lexicon based on Naver blog, we intend to create an Sentiment Analysis Library suitable for SNS review data.
 

## Mission Statement

 It creates an Korean Sentiment Lexicon that contains language expressions mainly used in reviews and appropriate expressions in the cafe domain. We want to create an open source library that measures the positive/negative score of a document using the created Sentiment Lexicon. In order to check the performance of this library and show examples using it, we would like to create a web that provides cafe information.
