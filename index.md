## Mission Statement
It creates an Korean Sentiment Lexicon that contains language expressions mainly used in reviews and appropriate
expressions in the cafe domain. We want to create an open source library that measures the positive/negative score of a
document using the created Sentiment Lexicon. In order to check the performance of this library and show examples
using it, we would like to create a web that provides cafe information.
